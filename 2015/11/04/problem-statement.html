  <h1>Version 3</h1>

<p>Finding typical positions of objects in environments.
Finding correlations in data(poistion of objects)
Finding patterns in locations of objects over an entire day as well as joint correlation
among additional attributes(day of the week, holiday, context of day)</p>

<h1>Version 2</h1>

<p>Finding typical positions of objects in the environments.
We provide some information regarding the typical arrangement of the
environments (what are the planar surfaces, what are they called)
The thesis is to bridge the gap between the Qualitative and Qantitative
representation of the data
We need to think of a small demo of using this data to be fed to a golog
planner</p>

<h1>Version 1</h1>

<p>Remembering sightings of objects with position and time.
Performing spatio-temporal clustering to learn about typical positions in the
environment reducing the time to find and retrieve objects.</p>
