title: Problem Statement
---

#Version 4
* Finding typical positions of objects in environments
* Mapping a single environment with long running environments
## Delta from other finding objects in environments
1 Learning locations in a single environment with a long running robot for multiple days
while most in the literature learn a general kitchen or a general office
environment
2 Adding temporal information to the object location and finding its influnence
in the position of the objects

#Version 3
* Finding typical positions of objects in environments.
* Finding correlations in data(poistion of objects)
* Finding patterns in locations of objects over an entire day as well as joint correlation
among additional attributes(day of the week, holiday, context of day)

#Version 2
* Finding typical positions of objects in the environments.
* We provide some information regarding the typical arrangement of the
environments (what are the planar surfaces, what are they called)
* The thesis is to bridge the gap between the Qualitative and Qantitative
representation of the data
* We need to think of a small demo of using this data to be fed to a golog
planner

#Version 1
* Remembering sightings of objects with position and time.
* Performing spatio-temporal clustering to learn about typical positions in the
environment reducing the time to find and retrieve objects.
