title: Whats I know about Probabilistic Programming
---

**Probabilistic Programming** is an upcoming filed in machine learning focusing
basically on developign new programming languages to do what can be generalized
as **Model Based Machine Learning**.

Many universities and industry giants have put formard their resources to
develop new languages. I will try to summarize in the post what all I have
learned about these.

# Programming Languages
- Pymc3
- BayesPy
- Infer.Net
- Figaro
- Church
- BayesDB

# Websites
- [PPAML]()
- [Other list of resources](http://ppaml.galois.com/wiki/wiki/Resources)
- [Daniel Roy Resources](http://probabilistic-programming.org/wiki/Home)

# Books
- [Bayesian Reasoning and Machine
  Learning](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.Online)
    - Book available online
    - Has a matlab based toolbox
- [Model Based Machine Learning](http://www.mbmlbook.com/)
    - Very intutive idea of Probabilistic Programming, Generative Modelling
    - Inductive Learning. Learning through examples.
    - Example using Infer.net

# Ipython Notebooks
