title:  Bayes Rule explained with evidence and facts examples

Bayes rule is one the most fundamental thing we learn in probabilistic theory,
yet the application of this simple rule seems a daunting effort. One of the
reason being the simplification of the problem to the coin and dice example.
There is a quote by Einstein which can be paraphased as this "Everything needs
to be made simple but not simpler". The above quote suits exact to our problem
here, we are so used to the coin and the dice problem that we have lost
interest in the field of probability. In this blog I will try to capture some
interesting problems to which bayesian rule can be applied to make proper
insight from the data.

Bayes' theorem
--------------
$$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)} $$
