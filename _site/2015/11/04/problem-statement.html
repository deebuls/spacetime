  <h1>Version 4</h1>

<ul>
<li>Finding typical positions of objects in environments</li>
<li>Mapping a single environment with long running environments

<h3>Delta from other finding objects in environments</h3></li>
<li>Learning locations in a single environment with a long running robot for multiple days
while most in the literature learn a general kitchen or a general office
environment</li>
<li>Adding temporal information to the object location and finding its influnence
in the position of the objects</li>
</ul>


<h1>Version 3</h1>

<ul>
<li>Finding typical positions of objects in environments.</li>
<li>Finding correlations in data(poistion of objects)</li>
<li>Finding patterns in locations of objects over an entire day as well as joint correlation
among additional attributes(day of the week, holiday, context of day)</li>
</ul>


<h1>Version 2</h1>

<ul>
<li>Finding typical positions of objects in the environments.</li>
<li>We provide some information regarding the typical arrangement of the
environments (what are the planar surfaces, what are they called)</li>
<li>The thesis is to bridge the gap between the Qualitative and Qantitative
representation of the data</li>
<li>We need to think of a small demo of using this data to be fed to a golog
planner</li>
</ul>


<h1>Version 1</h1>

<ul>
<li>Remembering sightings of objects with position and time.</li>
<li>Performing spatio-temporal clustering to learn about typical positions in the
environment reducing the time to find and retrieve objects.</li>
</ul>
